'''''Testing''''' is the third studio album by American rapper [[ASAP Rocky]]. It was released on May 25, 2018, by ASAP Worldwide, [[Polo Grounds Music]] and [[RCA Records]]. The album includes guest appearances from [[Frank Ocean]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Skepta]], [[French Montana]], [[Kodak Black]], [[Dev Hynes]] and [[FKA Twigs]], among others, and was produced primarily by Hector Delgado and ASAP Rocky himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers.

''Testing'' was supported by two singles: "[[ASAP Forever]]" and "[[Praise the Lord (Da Shine)]]", alongside numerous promotional singles. The album received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], earning 75,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s of which 13,000 were pure sales, becoming ASAP Rocky's third consecutive top-five album on the chart.

==Background==
In September 2017, ASAP Rocky announced the release of a new album, originally scheduled for a late 2017 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/10/23/asap-rocky-new-album-this-year-asap|title=A$AP Rocky still aiming to release his new album this year|work=The Fader|date=October 23, 2018|accessdate=May 25, 2018|archive-date=May 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525133737/http://www.thefader.com/2017/10/23/asap-rocky-new-album-this-year-asap|url-status=live}}</ref> The previous month, ASAP Rocky released ''[[Cozy Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy]]'' as part of the rap collective [[ASAP Mob]].

In January 2018, the album's title was cryptically left under [[SoundCloud]] song descriptions, until being officially confirmed in May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/asap-rocky-new-album-done-testing-artwork/|title=ASAP Rocky says new album Testing is "done," shares artwork|work=Consequence|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 25, 2018|archive-date=May 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525133011/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/asap-rocky-new-album-done-testing-artwork/|url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'', Rocky stated: "My new album is really about testing new sounds. People are scared to test new sounds, so they go with what's current 'cause it's the easy thing to do. The top 100 songs sound a certain way. People cater more to that because it's a bigger demographic behind that, or it's a guaranteed demographic behind that. I prefer to experiment and have my crowd grow with me and to reach new crowds. I don't just rap—I actually make music. That's why it takes time. These sonics represent me."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-gq-style-cover-story|title=A$AP Rocky Talks New Album, Under Armour Deal, and His Deep Love of Flowers|work=GQ|date=October 23, 2017|accessdate=May 25, 2018|archive-date=May 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525133327/https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-gq-style-cover-story|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Testing'' was met with generally positive reviews. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 67, based on eight reviews.<ref name="Metacritic"/> Aggregator [[AnyDecentMusic?]] gave it 6.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.<ref name="ADM"/>

Bansky Gonzalez of ''[[Consequence (publication)|Consequence]]'' gave a positive review, stating "It's a welcome addition to a genre that has become so occupied with spacey, bare-bones operations and overly simplistic results".<ref name="COS"/> Dean Van Nguyen of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that ''Testing'' is "completely out of step with any [[Hip hop music|mainstream rap]] album you're likely to hear this year", but "is a spottier affair" where "too many tracks minimise his strengths".<ref name="Guardian"/> Kassandra Guagliardi of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' stated that the album is "A [[Moulting|shedding]] of the 29-year-old artist's old skin and a rebirth of something more profound and slightly more complicated", complimenting the album's [[Experimental music|experimental]] aesthetic and identity.<ref name="Exclaim"/> Andreas Hale of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' complimented the album's experimentation but believed that ASAP Rocky is "still style over substance and his efforts at experimentation don't always click like he wants them to".<ref name="Billboard"/> Jake Boyer of ''[[Highsnobiety]]'' acclaimed ''Testing'', labelling it "an absolute triumph. It does not have the earth-shattering impact of his [[Long. Live. ASAP|genre-defining debut]], nor does it have any one track with as much immediacy as, say, a '[[Fuckin' Problems]]', but it is unequivocally his most thoughtful, most ambitious, and most rewarding project to date", praising the album's production, experimentation, cohesion and guest appearances.<ref name="Highsnobiety"/> Nina Hernandez of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said, "Though the finished project is as loose and incohesive as its title might suggest, there's a lot to like about ''Testing''".<ref name="The A.V. Club"/>

In a mixed review, online hip hop publication ''[[HipHopDX]]'' wrote that "There is no new movement birthed; there is no paradigm shift about the occur; it's simply as the title states: a series of harmonic evaluations meant to gauge audience reaction. Instead of creating a new wave, ASAP Rocky has drowned himself in his own ambitions and lost his identity along the way".<ref name="HipHopDX"/> Similarly, Stephen Kearse of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' believed there to be flaws in the experimentation, writing: "Rocky is enamored with collision. His approach to songcraft on ''Testing'' is to mash sounds together and capture the friction. The results are often dismal."<ref name="Pitchfork"/> Kevin Ritchie of ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' believed that "''Testing''{{'}}s title might suggest experimentation, but it delivers more on tentativeness, with a smattering of solid songs mixed into aesthetically interesting but unresolved experiments", criticizing the lyricism and flows that "aren't as ambitious as the production".<ref name="Now"/> Fred Thomas also provided a mixed review for [[AllMusic]], stating that "While in some ways ''Testing'' is more musical than anything we've heard from ASAP Rocky before, it's also more confused, with ideas and musical shifts colliding at times to the point of randomness. The album title itself refers to testing new sounds and pushing in new directions in hopes of growth. Like any set of experiments, ''Testing'' offers some success, some failure, and some moments that can only be met with a blank stare. Though songs like the gorgeous [[Frank Ocean]] collaboration 'Purity', or the darkly simmering '[[Fukk Sleep]]' featuring [[FKA Twigs]], take risks that push ASAP Rocky to new, exciting territory, some of the experiments that made it onto ''Testing'' could have been left bubbling over in the lab rather than weighing down the rest of the album".<ref name="AllMusic"/>
