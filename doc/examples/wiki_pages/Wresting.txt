===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998–2004)===

====The Corporation (1998–1999)====
{{main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)}}
Martin debuted in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] on the October 25, 1998, episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' as an unnamed [[bodyguard]] for the band [[Mötley Crüe]], who were performing on the show. In a scripted event, Martin threw an overzealous fan off the stage during the band's rehearsal. On the December 14, 1998, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', Martin aligned himself with [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] by attacking The Rock's rival [[Triple H]].<ref name="Oliver4"/> A week later on the December 21 episode of ''Raw'', Martin made his in ring debut teaming with The Rock to defeat Triple H and [[X-Pac]] by disqualification. Martin went on to join [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], a wrestling stable consisting of numerous other wrestlers. During this time, he received the ring name "Test", since he usually [[soundcheck|checked the mic]] saying "test...test..."<ref name="TestProfile">{{cite news|title=Capsule Profile 335: Test|work=The Wrestler/Inside Wrestling|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=Volume 15, 2007|page=18|date=June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/bruce-prichard-reveals-the-origin-of-andrew-martins-test-gimmick/|title=411MANIA|website=Bruce Prichard Reveals the Origin of Andrew Martin’s Test Gimmick}}</ref>

On the January 11, 1999, episode of ''Raw is War'', Test competed in a [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] vs. [[D-Generation X|D-X]] Corporate Rumble, which was won by [[Chyna]], making her the 30th entrant in the upcoming Royal Rumble. At the [[Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match but was eliminated by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. On the March 8 episode of ''Raw'', Test defeated X-Pac. At [[WrestleMania XV]] on March 28, Test teamed with [[D'Lo Brown]] in a WWF Tag Team Championship title match against [[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Owen Hart]] where Jarrett and Hart retained their titles. Along with Triple H, he helped [[Shane McMahon]] retain the European Championship against X-Pac at WrestleMania XV. After being removed from the Corporation, Martin joined [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]] who were known to carry 2x4 boards of wood with them. The group briefly [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with the Corporation and at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]], [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]] defeated [[The Corporate Ministry]] in an Eight-man [[elimination tag team match]], before quietly disbanding.<ref name="TestProfile"/>

====Relationship with Stephanie McMahon and T & A (1999–2000)====
{{main|T & A (professional wrestling)}}
Martin then began an on-screen relationship with [[Stephanie McMahon]] that would lead to a "Love her or Leave her" match at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]]. He went on to defeat [[Shane McMahon]] at SummerSlam in 1999, gaining Shane's blessing, which led to an on-screen engagement between Stephanie and Martin.<ref name="TestProfile"/> Later in the storyline, [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]] hit Stephanie with a trash can, which caused her to develop amnesia. Plans for the wedding continued however, and on the night of the wedding Test defeated Triple H with a quick 3-count from a referee in a [[Vince McMahon]] mask. Triple H later showed a video which revealed that he had drugged Stephanie and had taken her to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he married her in a drive-through ceremony. Stephanie then turned on Test and aligned herself with Triple H, ushering in the McMahon-Helmsley Era.<ref name="TestProfile"/> Test then had a short feud with DX. On the December 6 episode of ''Raw'', Test and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] were defeated by Triple H and X-Pac. DX would go on to break his nose and force him into matches like a [[handicap match]] against [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] and Albert. On the December 12 episode of ''Heat'', Test faced [[Al Snow]] in a losing effort. The next night on ''Raw is War'', Test teamed with Triple H to face the [[New Age Outlaws]] resulting in Triple H turning on and assaulting him. The next week on ''Raw is War'', Triple H would continue to torment him by putting him in a handicap match against the [[New Age Outlaws]], calling it a "Christmas present". On the January 17 episode of ''Raw is War'', Test defeated The Big Boss Man to win the WWF Hardcore Championship. At the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by The [[Big Show]]. Test then lost the [[WWF Hardcore Championship]] to [[Crash Holly]] on the February 24 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]''. Test then turned heel and formed a [[tag team]] with [[Matt Bloom|Albert]]. The two were known as [[T & A (professional wrestling)|T & A]] (Test and Albert) and were managed by [[Trish Stratus]]. At [[WrestleMania 2000]] they defeated [[Al Snow]] and [[Steve Blackman]]. Then at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], T & A (with Trish Stratus) defeated the [[Dudley Boyz]]. At [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]], T & A were defeated in a Four corners elimination match for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] by [[Edge & Christian]]. At [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]], T & A and Trish Stratus lost to the [[Hardy Boyz]] and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] in a Six-person mixed tag team match. At [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]], Test competed in a Hardcore Open Invitational for the WWF Hardcore Championship which was won by Steve Blackman. At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], T & A and Trish Stratus competed against the [[Acolytes Protection Agency]] ([[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]) and Lita, which ended in a no contest because of T & A attacking The APA before the match. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], T & A and Trish Stratus faced Steve Blackman, Crash Holly and [[Molly Holly]] in a losing effort.

====The Invasion and various feuds (2000–2002)====
{{Main|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|l1=The Invasion|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l2=The Alliance}}
On December 28, 2000, Albert attacked Test at the orders of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, effectively disbanding T & A and turning Test face again.<ref name="TestProfile"/>

Again a singles wrestler, Test eliminated [[William Regal]] during the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|2001 Royal Rumble]] match and subsequently defeated him the next night on ''Raw is War'' to win the [[WWE European Championship|WWF European Championship]].<ref name="TestProfile"/> Test then feuded with [[Eddie Guerrero]], losing the European Championship to him at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] following interference from [[Dean Malenko]] and [[Perry Saturn]]. On the April 30 episode of ''Raw is War'', Test defeated Triple H by disqualification after Triple H hit him with a chair and powerbombed him through the announce table.<ref name="TestProfile"/> At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Test competed in a Triple threat hardcore match for the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]] which was won by [[Rhyno]]. On the June 14 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Rhyno to win the Hardcore Championship but he would lose the title back to Rhyno on the June 25 episode of ''Raw is War''.

During the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion storyline]], [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] were suspicious of Test's friendship with Shane McMahon, prior to Shane's heel turn and the formation of the [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] half of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]].<ref name="TestProfile"/> They decided to attack Test because they thought he was the mole within the WWF, only to find out he wasn't. In retaliation, on the August 9, 2001, episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Test turned heel once again by joining The Alliance by helping Alliance members [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeat the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE, 1971–2010)|WWF Tag Team Championship]]. Teaming with [[The Dudley Boyz]], Test went on to pin Bradshaw at [[SummerSlam (2001)|SummerSlam]] to defeat the APA and [[Spike Dudley]] in a six-man tag team match. The next day on ''Raw is War'', Stephanie approached Test with the task of beating [[Chris Jericho]] after Rhyno failed to do so at SummerSlam. Despite past conflicts, they shook hands, thus finally resolving the grudge between himself and Stephanie. After Test won the match against Jericho he would defeat Kane at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]]. He then began teaming with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] regularly in September 2001. Together they defeated [[The Brothers of Destruction]] on the September 27 episode of ''SmackDown!'' to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|WCW Tag Team Championship]]. However they would go on to lose the titles to [[The Hardy Boyz]] on the October 8 episode of ''Raw''. On the November 1 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test and Booker T defeated [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Chris Jericho]] to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE, 1971–2010)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], which they would go on to also lose to The Hardy Boyz eleven days later on ''Raw''.

Following this, Test returned to singles competition and began feuding with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. After defeating Edge to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]], Test lost the title back to him in a unification match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Championship]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]].<ref name="TestProfile"/> On the same night, he won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which granted him on-screen immunity from being fired for a year after attacking and taking the place of [[Scotty 2 Hotty]]. For the next few weeks, a storyline was built around Test using that immunity to justify attacking fellow wrestlers but the storyline went nowhere and shortly after the year turned it was dropped. At [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]], Test and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] were defeated by Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert. At the 2002 [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. At [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]], Test and Booker T faced [[Tazz]] and [[Spike Dudley]] for the WWF Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles. At [[WrestleMania X8]], Test, [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] and Lance Storm lost to Rikishi, Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert in six-man tag team match on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]''.

At the [[2002 WWF draft lottery]], Test was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown! brand]]. On the May 2 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test and Christian defeated [[Mark Henry]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]. On the May 9 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Mark Henry. On the May 23 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated [[Randy Orton]]. On the May 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Triple H. On the June 13 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] in a King of the Ring qualifier. The next week, Test defeated [[Hardcore Holly]] in a Quarterfinals match but would go on to lose in the semi-finals of the [[King of the Ring (2002)|King of the Ring]] tournament to the eventual winner, [[Brock Lesnar]]. On the July 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test, Christian and [[Lance Storm]] formed [[The Un-Americans]]. On the July 25 episode of ''SmackDown!'', [[John Cena]] poked fun at him so he slapped him which led to a match where Cena won. On the July 29 episode of ''Raw'', The Un-Americans left SmackDown! and joined the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]]. Later that night they attacked [[The Undertaker]].

The storyline culminated in a match at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] where Undertaker defeated Test.<ref name="TestProfile"/> The Un-Americans lost to the team of Kane, Goldust, Booker T and Bubba Ray Dudley at [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]] and after a series of losses The Un-Americans divided, and the stable split in brawling fashion and disbanded in September 2002.

====Relationship with Stacy Keibler and departure (2002–2004)====
[[File:Andrew Martin-Test at ECW Live.jpg|thumb|Test at an ECW live event in 2007]]
In October 2002, after the Un-Americans dissolved, Test received [[Stacy Keibler]] as his on-screen girlfriend and "image [[consultant]]". This began by Keibler telling Test he should embrace his fanbase and call them his "[[Testicle]]s", in line with The Rock's fan group, the "People", [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]'s "Kaneanites", [[Chris Jericho]]'s "Jerichoholics" and [[Hulk Hogan]]'s "Hulkamaniacs". This eventually culminated with Test cutting off his long hair and trading his trademark leather pants for normal wrestling trunks. The couple were originally heels, but due to the popularity of the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], quickly became faces.<ref name="TestProfile"/> At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|2003 Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the [[Royal Rumble match]], but was eliminated by [[Dave Bautista|Batista]]. In May, Test formed a tag team with the returning [[Scott Steiner]], at the request of Keibler, and at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]], they faced [[La Résistance (professional wrestling)|La Résistance]] in a losing effort. Later in the night, he went on to compete in a [[battle royal]] for the vacant [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]], but it was eventually won by Christian. Test and Keibler eventually split up due to the ongoing mistreatment of Keibler at the hands of Test, while turning him heel again and developed a [[misogynist]] streak. At [[Bad Blood (2003)|Bad Blood]], Steiner defeated Test for Keibler's managerial services. On the August 18 episode of ''Raw'', Test defeated Steiner, winning the services of Keibler and announcing his intentions to "make her a [[Prostitution|whore]]". At [[Unforgiven (2003)|Unforgiven]], Test again defeated Steiner, forcing him to become his [[Domestic worker|manservant]].<ref name="TestProfile"/> Steiner then attacked Keibler, blaming her for the loss and for him having to take orders from another man. Test then freed Steiner from his obligation, and the pair became a tag team once again, as now both treated Keibler like a slave. The two challenged for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE, 1971–2010)|World Tag Team Championship]] on multiple occasions but came up short each time. The pair were then fired by [[Mick Foley]] (therefore freeing Keibler from their control), who was the on-screen Co-General Manager for two nights, thus finally ending the year-long angle. They were then re-hired by [[Eric Bischoff]], upon his return to the position of Raw General Manager. At [[Armageddon (2003)|Armageddon]], Test and Scott Steiner competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles.

Test then had a short feud with [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]] in January 2004, which started after Test kicked [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] (Richard's on-screen girlfriend) in the jaw. They fought several times on ''Sunday Night Heat'', with Richards winning every match. On the January 19 episode of ''Raw'', Test competed in a Triple Threat Royal Rumble Qualifying Match against [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and Steiner. After Goldberg won the match Test and Steiner would officially disband. At the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]], Test was found knocked out backstage by some officials and the ''Raw'' Sheriff Stone Cold Steve Austin when it was his turn to enter. Austin ordered someone to quickly replace Test as the 21st rumble entrant. The person who attacked him and replaced him was revealed to be Mick Foley. Test would gain some revenge on the February 2 episode of ''Raw'', when he and [[Randy Orton]] attacked Foley in a backstage area. Test would start competing against the likes of [[Rico Constantino|Rico]] and Stevie Richards regularly on ''Heat''. On the March 1 episode of ''Raw'', Test and [[Matt Hardy]] were defeated by [[Rob Van Dam]] and Booker T. Test would go on to compete on house shows until he reaggravated the neck injury that had kept him out of action the past few months.

Martin had [[spinal fusion]] surgery performed by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]] in July 2004. On November 1, 2004, it was announced that he was released from his WWE contract along with [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]] and [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wwe.com/news/headlines/1282851 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041102035358/http://www.wwe.com/news/headlines/1282851 |archive-date=November 2, 2004 |title=A-Train, Billy Gunn, Test released |publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] |date=November 1, 2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2023}}</ref>

===Independent circuit, Italy, and Australia (2005-2006)===
Test returned to the ring in May 2005, and began accepting bookings with various [[independent circuit|independent promotions]]. On August 27, 2005, Test wrestled at [[WrestleReunion|WrestleReunion 2]] teaming with [[Bill Eadie|The Masked Superstar]], [[Steve Corino]], and [[Matt Osborne|The Original Evil Clown]] losing to [[D'Lo Brown]], [[The Blue Meanie]], [[Tom Prichard]] and [[Dusty Rhodes]] in Philadelphia. One of his most notable victories during this tenure was against former TNA wrestler [[Samoa Joe]] for World Series Wrestling in Australia. His most prominent role in the independent circuit was in the Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion in Italy, where he took on the ring name "Big Foot", due to his "big boot" finishing move. He also feuded with [[Mark Jindrak]] in January 2006 in Italy.

===Return to WWE (2006–2007)===
[[File:AndrewMartinECWLive.jpg|left|thumb|Test making his entrance on ECW]]

On the August 1 episode of ''ECW'', Test and Mike Knox defeated Sandman and [[Tommy Dreamer]] in an Extreme Rules match, with Test pinning Dreamer. On the September 5 episode of ''ECW'', Test and Mike Knox lost to [[Rob Van Dam and Sabu]] in an Extreme Rules Match.

[[File:Test (Andrew Martin).jpg|thumb|Test at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]]]]
On the November 7 episode of ''ECW'', Test defeated [[Tommy Dreamer]] to earn a spot in the [[Elimination Chamber#Match history|Extreme Elimination Chamber]] at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]]. Test was a member of Team Big Show (Big Show, Test, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay and Umaga) facing Team Cena (John Cena, Kane, Bobby Lashley, Sabu and Rob Van Dam) at [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]]. During the match, Test eliminated Rob Van Dam but was eventually eliminated by Sabu. Team Big Show eventually lost. At December to Dismember, he eliminated Hardcore Holly and Rob Van Dam in the Extreme Elimination Chamber match for the [[ECW World Championship]], before being pinned by the eventual winner [[Bobby Lashley]].<ref name="TestProfile"/> On the January 16, 2007, episode of ''ECW'', Test competed in a triple threat match for the ECW World Championship, which was won by Bobby Lashley.

Following these defeats, Test would disappear from WWE television.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007)===

It was reported that in August 2008, Martin entered a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] after reaching out to WWE, his former employer, for help regarding his substance abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2009/04/11/wrestler-s-death-ruled-accidental-overdose/%3foutputType=amp|title=Wrestler's Death Ruled Accidental Overdose|work=Tampa Bay Times|author=Robbyn Mitchell|date=April 13, 2009}}</ref> Martin's body was cremated and his remains were flown to his family in his hometown of [[Whitby, Ontario]].

Forensic pathologist [[Bennet Omalu]] later determined that Martin had severe [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), a brain condition caused by repeated concussions and subconcussive head injuries. Fellow Canadian wrestler and one of Martin's idols, [[Chris Benoit]], also suffered from CTE before his death in June 2007, and it was determined to be a factor in the [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=4724912|author=Garber, Greg|title=Doctors: Wrestler had brain damage|date=December 9, 2009|work=ESPN.com}}</ref>
