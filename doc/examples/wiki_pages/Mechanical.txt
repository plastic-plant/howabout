'''Mechanical testing''' covers a wide range of tests, which can be divided broadly into two types:
# those that aim to determine a material's [[List of materials properties#mechanical properties|mechanical properties]], independent of geometry.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1152/ajpgi.00324.2018 | title=Differential biomechanical properties of mouse distal colon and rectum innervated by the splanchnic and pelvic afferents | year=2019 | last1=Siri | first1=Saeed | last2=Maier | first2=Franz | last3=Chen | first3=Longtu | last4=Santos | first4=Stephany | last5=Pierce | first5=David M. | last6=Feng | first6=Bin | journal=American Journal of Physiology.

# those that determine the response of a structure to a given action, e.g. testing of composite beams, aircraft structures to destruction, etc.

[[File:Eprouvette plate cassee wb.JPG|thumb|Tensile test. A standard specimen is subjected to a gradually increasing load (force) until failure occurs. The resultant load-displacement behaviour is used to determine a [[stress–strain curve]], from which a number of mechanical properties can be measured.]]
There exists a large number of tests, many of which are standardized, to determine the various mechanical properties of materials. In general, such tests set out to obtain geometry-independent properties; i.e. those intrinsic to the bulk material. In practice this is not always feasible, since even in tensile tests, certain properties can be influenced by specimen size and/or geometry. Here is a listing of some of the most common tests:<ref name="Smithells">Ed. Gale, W.F.; Totemeier, T.C. (2004), Smithells Metals Reference Book (8th Edition), Elsevier</ref>

*[[Hardness Testing]]
**[[Vickers hardness test]] (HV), which has one of the widest scales
**[[Brinell hardness test]] (HB)
**[[Knoop hardness test]] (HK), for measurement over small areas
**[[Janka hardness test]], for wood
**[[Meyer hardness test]]
**[[Rockwell scale|Rockwell hardness test]] (HR), principally used in the USA
**[[Shore durometer]] hardness, used for polymers
**[[Barcol hardness test]], for composite materials
*[[Tensile testing]], used to obtain the stress-strain curve for a material, and from there, properties such as Young modulus, yield (or proof) stress, tensile stress and % elongation to failure.
*Impact testing
**[[Izod test]]
**[[Charpy test]]
*[[Fracture toughness]] testing
**Linear-elastic (K<sub>Ic</sub>)
**K–R curve
**Elastic plastic (J<sub>Ic</sub>, CTOD)
*[[Viscoplasticity#Creep test|Creep Testing]], for the mechanical behaviour of materials at high temperatures (relative to their melting point)
*[[Fatigue Testing]], for the behaviour of materials under cyclic loading
**Load-controlled smooth specimen tests
**Strain-controlled smooth specimen tests
**Fatigue crack growth testing
*[[Non-Destructive Testing]]
