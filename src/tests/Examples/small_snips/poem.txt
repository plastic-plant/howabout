Yesterday I ate too much,
Today I'm feeling quite out of touch.
But tomorrow's a brand new day,
I'll eat less, or so I'll say.
Yet when tomorrow becomes today,
I'll probably eat just as much anyway!

Yesterday I tripped and fell,
Today I ache, oh what the hell!
But tomorrow I'll be nimble and spry,
Or at least that's what I'll try.

Yesterday I lost my keys,
Today I'm searching on my knees.
But tomorrow I'll be more organized,
Or so I've fantasized.

Yesterday I slept through my alarm,
Today I'm feeling quite alarmed.
But tomorrow I'll wake up on time,
I'll be early, feeling sublime.
Yet when tomorrow becomes today,
I'll hit snooze and sleep my day away!
